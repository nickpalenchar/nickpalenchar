### Special prefixes in my workspace

I prefix repos with a word followed by underscore (_) to categorize certain repos with similar purposes.

- **`learning_`**: used for learning and note-taking, often in a specific course. The link to the course is usually in the description. _These repos are often experimental and personal. There is no guarantee for accuracy, correctness or completeness of its content._
- **`myscript_`**: This is some sort of script I'm using in my personal workflows. It's often automating something I don't want to do myself. _Unless otherwise licened, these scripts are free to reuse and modify, but they are not written for an audiance beyond myself. They generally will not follow best-practices, and have no guarantees as to quality or promise of service/results. As such, AUTHOR ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHEN USING SUCH SCRIPTS._
- **`poc_`**: "Proof of concept" - generally a standalone, frozen-in-time demo for illustrative or educational purpose. Rarely maintained beyond initial completion.
- **`sandbox_`**: General repo where I mess around, make POC's, etc. One repo often represents messing around in a certain language, such as [sandbox_python](https://github.com/nickpalenchar/sandbox_python)
