    <p>No annoying intro here. This is it:</p>
<h2 id="when-starting-a-blog-be-sure-to-update-it-regularly">&ldquo;When starting a blog, be sure to update it regularly&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually heard or read this general &ldquo;nugget&rdquo; many times. It is as ubiquitous as it is terrible. One reason is that it&rsquo;s only applicable to one type of blog. The kind that is monetized, relying on a large group of subscribers, with aspirations of generating a livable wage for the author. Obviously, there are many types of blogs.</p>
<p>Back in 2018 I had set a goal to publish one post a month. I thought it was modest at the time (some authors seem to post weekly at least), but it turned out to be GRUELING. It also didn&rsquo;t produce work I was most proud of. The result of this goal is most of the 2018 posts on this site (you might notice there&rsquo;s less than 12).</p>
<p>The fact that I couldn&rsquo;t commit made me question if I should even host a blog at all. I felt like a blog with large gaps in the timeline would give the same impression a &ldquo;streaky&rdquo; resume gives off. As a matter-of-fact, the aforementioned terrible advice is often paired with a warning that you will look like you lack a drive for commitment, which could turn off recruiters during the job search, if you don&rsquo;t post regularly.</p>
<p>This is equally misguided. When I look at my blog, I see a collection of articles that generally represents my thoughts on coding, and general values in the industry. These are topics that are valuable to me, the topics I want to talk about. I don&rsquo;t want it cluttered with noise that is less helpful to readers or myself. Form the viewpoint of a recruiter, wouldn&rsquo;t they rather find content that supports the author&rsquo;s expertise in the field?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure what my blog is. Heck why does it matter? I just enjoy my tiny space on the corner of the internet I can call my own! Maybe it&rsquo;s a subtle rebellion against larger platforms (blog and social media based). But the autonomy makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s helpful to write my thoughts whenever I&rsquo;m moved to do so. And I hope the result is a collection of genuine thoughts and advice that others might find helpful, too.</p>
