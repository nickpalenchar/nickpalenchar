    <p>I just finished listening to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/04/1096726920/escheat-show-classic">Escheat show</a> on NPR&rsquo;s Planet money, and learned all about Escheat Law (process?)</p>
<p>Escheat is a process where seamingly &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; properties is reported to the state for the owner to claim it&ndash;sort of a lost-and-found for the state residences.</p>
<p>I searched my name and found 70$ from an old savings account. That&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>I recommend everyone do this. Google &ldquo;unclaimed property <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; and skip the first ad-supported link or two.</p>
<p>More than money can be Echeated; personal proerty, lockboxes, stocks and bonds, pretty much anything that can be considered &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NPR story follows the unfortunate side of Escheat. TL:DR; a man bought an Amazon stock in the late 90s on ETrade and left it alone for 20 years. Because he didn&rsquo;t log in it was Eceated in 2008, <em>and the stock was sold at market value at that time</em>, so the man who would&rsquo;ve had $100k now has $8k in cash (a profit of $2k). Oy I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>Keep track of your accounts I guess?!</p>
<h3 id="how-im-keeping-track-of-my-acconuts">How I&rsquo;m keeping track of my acconuts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>TrueBill</strong> is an app that keeps track of your subscriptons, you can also link most accounts. It&rsquo;s pretty good, but I suspect it will go downhill in the next 5 years (the same way every multi-accounts managment app have since its Genisis with Mint).</li>
<li><strong>Financial Managers</strong> - Most of my accounts are managed by a Fiduciary. Having an actual team of qualified humans watching accounts is well worth the couple thousand dollars it costs.</li>
<li><strong>Manual checking is in my routine</strong> - I have a weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly routine, and checking on my accounts is the monthly one, so I don&rsquo;t think any of my accounts is likely to be Escheated.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>P.S. This is a &ldquo;lifestream&rdquo; post, where I just write for no particular audiance. I&rsquo;ve found writting out thoughts to be extreamly powerful in my personal life, and I want to start snapshotting thoughts in time. I bet it will be interesting to look back on one day.</em></p>
