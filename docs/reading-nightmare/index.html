    <p>I came across a quote in <a href="https://blog.owulveryck.info/2021/10/07/reading-from-the-web-offline-and-distraction-free.html">Reading from the web offline and distraction-free</a>, which was in-turn quoted from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817073201/http://lab.arc90.com/2009/03/02/readability/">The Readability Project</a>, which I will now shamelessly
echo in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading anything on the Internet has become a full-on nightmare. As media outlets attempt to eke out as much advertising revenue as possible, we’re left trying to put blinders on to mask away all the insanity that surrounds the content we’re trying to read.</p>
<p>It’s almost like listening to talk radio, except the commercials play during the program in the background. It’s a pretty awful experience. Our friend to date has been the trusty “Print View” button. Click it and all the junk goes away. I click it all the time and rarely print. It’s really become the “Peace &amp; Quiet” button for many.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decline into the hyperactive <a href="/digital-minimalism">attention economy</a> was not instantaneous. Maybe that&rsquo;s why
insistent ads, pop-ups and habit trackers can feel normal and expected to many trying to do anything on the net. But
if you&rsquo;re like me it&rsquo;s infuriating. The analogy of commercials in the background really hit home for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to add except that I don&rsquo;t want to forget, so it&rsquo;s going on my [ad- and tracking-free] site. <a href="/organizing-knowledge">where I won&rsquo;t forget it.</a></p>
