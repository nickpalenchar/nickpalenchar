      <description>When my employer is hiring, I&amp;rsquo;m the first to want to refer a good person. I&amp;rsquo;ll reach out to my network of bootcamp grads, asking for resumes, hoping I can get them a job at a great company.
I end up throwing out 99% of them every time.
The reason is always the same: their GitHub has half a year or much more of total radio silence.
If there&amp;rsquo;s one piece of advice I could shout from the rooftops, especially to new devs, is that an active GitHub is probably your best competitive advantage to getting an interview or referral cold.</description>

I spent the day meeting engineers from every department, and was asked to whiteboard solutions to many problems. Some were very mathmatical algorithms, others were architectures for things like microservices and AWS. Among the questions, my favorite was making a URL shortener, similar to bit.ly.
THE CHALLENGE Design a URL shortener app. It should have a dashboard for users that can submit a link to be shortened.</description>
