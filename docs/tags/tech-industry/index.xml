      <description>When my employer is hiring, I&amp;rsquo;m the first to want to refer a good person. I&amp;rsquo;ll reach out to my network of bootcamp grads, asking for resumes, hoping I can get them a job at a great company.

The reason is always the same: their GitHub has half a year or much more of total radio silence.
If there&amp;rsquo;s one piece of advice I could shout from the rooftops, especially to new devs, is that an active GitHub is probably your best competitive advantage to getting an interview or referral cold.</description>

I read the Tech Crunch article. I read the FreeCodeCamp article. For good measure, I also read the Coding Horror article mentioned by the FreeCodeCamp article. My reaction? They all have valid points and are all worth reading.</description>
