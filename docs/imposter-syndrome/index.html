      <p>We all know about Imposter Syndrome yet the epidemic seems to be growing, especially when breaking into a new career (like those learning to code). No doubt I&rsquo;ve felt it in tech and elsewhere in life, as I&rsquo;m sure you have. While there&rsquo;s plenty of <a href="https://guide.freecodecamp.org/working-in-tech/imposter-syndrome">articles</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whyUPLJZljE">videos</a> on how to fight the self-doubt that comes along with Imposter Syndrome, I&rsquo;d like to offer an alternative approach:</p>
<p><em>Use it.</em></p>
<p>You can try to fight Impostor Syndrome or change your mindset, and doing so has worked for some people. Not me. Instead, I use Impostor Syndrome as a primary motivation to learn new and difficult skills. For me, the recognition that I am currently uncomfortable and filled with self-doubt drives me to obliterate those feelings by means of mastery. Not only can Impostor Syndrome be a motivator, but it can also be a validator; <strong>I keep on working for as long as it takes until the feeling of Impostor Syndrome isn&rsquo;t there anymore.</strong></p>
<h1 id="impostor-syndrome-as-a-motivator">Impostor Syndrome as a Motivator</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s well recognized that Impostor Syndrome is not necessarily a bad thing. In many ways, it can signal that you care about the work you are doing. While I try to eliminate it through mastery when experienced, the complete absence of Impostor Syndrome can be a signal that you are probably in the wrong field or focusing on the wrong thing. In these situation, I take a hard an honest look about why I <em>really</em> want to learn something.</p>
<p>Conversely, the feeling of Impostor Syndrome is often the first step to in rewarding self-growth. Where there&rsquo;s feelings of doubt in a certain area, there are often feelings of success and gratifications if we stay the course. As a rule, whenever resistance is felt in a certain area, that&rsquo;s exactly the direction you should go in, and turning the obstacle (Impostor Syndrome) into a motivator has been the best way for me to prioritize what I should focus on. If this doesn&rsquo;t happen naturally, you can start by changing mindset. Simply change the way you define Impostor Syndrome, from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obstacle: I feel like an imposter and therefore should not be doing what I am currently doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Motivation: I feel like an imposter and therefore should <em>learn more</em> about what I am currently doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understand that avoiding Imposter Syndrome altogether results in being stuck in your comfort zone. Although you&rsquo;ve successfully blocked out self-doubt, you&rsquo;ve also blocked out self-growth and self-satisfaction in the process. No good!</p>
<h1 id="what-does-beating-imposter-syndrome-look-like">What does &ldquo;beating&rdquo; imposter syndrome look like?</h1>
<p>One thing I love about the tech industry is the quantifiable skills. When you know something, you can prove your worth again in again. I&rsquo;ve beaten my own &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; Impostor Syndrome by building API&rsquo;s, certifying with Amazon Web Services, architecting infrastructure that remains stable, and receiving positive feedback on all my technical interviews in the past year. The best result is not only do I feel a strong sense of accomplishment, but I&rsquo;m wildly confident in what I know. This is also known as conscious competence, the final phase of learning, and it feels great!</p>
<p>Confidence should not be mistaken with arrogance, however. I&rsquo;m also wildly confident about <em>what I don&rsquo;t know</em>. I try to be the first to admit I don&rsquo;t understand something&ndash;it&rsquo;s easy for me to do now because I am secure enough in my areas of expertise that I can acknowledge when something is beyond it. Furthermore, I view these new things as a way to expand my skills even more!</p>
<h1 id="important-subtleties-to-note">Important subtleties to note</h1>
<p>This article is very work-your-ass-off oriented, but it&rsquo;s equally important to take breaks and make sure your work does not consume your entire life (see &ldquo;burnout&rdquo;).</p>
<p>After I achieve a huge goal, I always take a&ndash;sometimes extended&ndash;amount of time for some serious rest-and-recovery. Maybe it&rsquo;s my work-hard-play-hard nature, but I&rsquo;m a big fan of drilling down three months at a time followed handful more of steady work with days off and lots of Netflix (or hiking) in between. And of course, when preparing for the next round of hard work, I ensure I&rsquo;m fully recovered and mentally prepared for the new tasks ahead. A war is more than just the battle and you can&rsquo;t always be fighting it; there&rsquo;s lots of preparation and recovery needed to ensure you&rsquo;re at peak performance before the actual charge begins.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed my two cents on Impostor Syndrome. As a post script I&rsquo;ll admit that writing this article made me feel like a bit of&hellip; a fraud (so meta!). Guess I&rsquo;ll have to keep learning how to improve my writing until I&rsquo;ve beaten Impostor Syndrome once again!</p>
