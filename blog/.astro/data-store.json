VCS is the backbone for agile collaboration, allowing each developer to have their own copy of some codebase, where they can work at their own pace and merge changes back into a master copy when ready.\n\n## Figuring out git\n\nIf you or your company uses GitHub, you're probably very familiar with git. Depending on how well you can wrangle the CLI, git can be amazingly useful or incredibly infuriating. And like everyone else using git, I've ran into numerous problems and found my own various ways out of them. As my experience grew I began to keep a log of \"git solutions\", which in turn revealed a few useful commands I commonly employ. While simple, they've come in handy time and again. Maybe they'll come in handy for you as well!\n\nI call these commands \"life-changing\" because they are so simple yet pretty unknown. But most importantly, after adopting them you will probably find notable differences in your workflow. You'll (hopefully) spend less time on git and more time on what matters--pushing that code!\n\n### git remote -v\n\nThe `-v` option stands for \"verbose\". Many people use `git remote` to verify a remote (usually named `origin`) was added to a repo. Fine for that single case, but we don't get much more information. Especially since most repos have only one remote, frequently with the same `origin` name. If you want a bit more info, `-v` gives you the URL to which those generic `origin` remotes are actually pointing too. I like to think of it as knowing what the value of a variable is in a certain instance, which is often helpful in debugging situations.\n\n**Why it's life-changing:** Ever have a directory you _think_ linked to a certain remote repo but wasn't sure? A directory holding a git project does not have to have the same name as the repo on, say, GitHub, so it could be a similar or vastly outdated repo. Out of caution, some developers might just delete the directory and re-clone the repo, ensuring it is the project they want. But `git remote -v` can validate the remote repo in one step. Observe this sample output:\n\n```shell\n$ git remote -v\norigin  https://github.com/nickpalenchar/nickpalenchar.git (fetch)\norigin  https://github.com/nickpalenchar/nickpalenchar.git (push)\n```\nThe location of where I ran this command is a repo that is linked to my `nickpalenchar` repository under my username (`nickpalenchar`). No recloning needed!\n\n### git commit --allow-empty -m 'your message...'\n\nGenerally, when you try to commit when nothing is staged for doing so, you'll get a `nothing to commit, working tree clean` response, with no commit made. The `--allow-empty` flag bypasses this saftey check, allowing (you guessed it) an empty commit. So even when nothing is staged or changed, a commit will be written to the git log.\n\n**Why it's life-changing:** (I love showing off this one.) There are lots of situations where you need to test doing something with a new commit in order to verify some sort of workflow. A common scenario in my work is verifying a webhook in Continuous Integration will pick up a newly pushed branch. I _could_ `touch yet_another_new_file`, then add it, _then_ commit it. Or I could `git commit --allow-empty -m 'empty commit for debugging'` and push that. So convenient. Just one word of warning: you probably don't want this in a more formal codebase; but it's great for a prototyping/testing repo that you will dispose of.\n\n### git stash / git stash pop\n\nAdmittedly a little more well-known, but if you _weren't_ aware of `stash`, I'm glad I can take this opportunity to enlighten you. `git stash` sets all your working changes aside (on a stack) and gives you a clean working directory. You can git stash multiple times, and the most recent stash will be at the top if the stack that git has been adding them too. As it goes with stacks, `git stash pop` will pop the top-most set of working changes and add them back to the branch you're currently on, ready to be modified or committed.\n\n**Why it's life-changing:** The most common use for a quick `git stash`/`git stash pop` is to move the working changes you've made from one branch to another. Say you've started working on some changes, only to realize you're on the `master` branch! Depending on your repo setup (and if you're in a team), you probably can't push changes from your master branch. You're stuck! This is the classic opportunity for the stash command. Simply `git stash` to set those changes aside, restoring your master branch to good-standing cleanness. Then `git checkout` the branch you intended to use and `git stash pop`. All your new work has been seamlessly moved from one branch to another!\n\n### git rm --cached\n\nAnother one that's a bit well known, but not known enough in my opinion (or I wouldn't still be removing files that were considered removed). `git rm` can remove a file that has previously been committed, but adding `--cached` will better ensure it does not come back.\n\n**Why it's life-changing:** It's life changing when trying to update a `.gitingore` file. Life gets tough when you `git add .` and commit before you remember to add a certain file to a `.gitignore`. Now you have a file tracked that you did not want. To fix this problem in a fool-proof way, you can `git rm --cached name_of_file` (for directory use `git rm --cached -r name_of_dir`), add the file to `.gitignore` and commit all changes. You won't find that file ever showing up in that repo's tracking again. Another word of caution: this is NOT a solution for removing secrets that were accidentally committed, as they will still exist in the git log! But for something like say, removing `node_modules`, this would be the perfect solution.\n\n### Bonus: git auto-complete\n\nNot an actual command but I had to include as it's probably the biggest life-changing thing you can do with git! Git autocomplete will save you a _LOT_ of time (both in typing and fixing typos). Once set up, you'll be able to start typing a few characters of a name, then tab to auto-complete or see all possibilities of the current name fragment. It can autocomplete names of git subcommands, remotes, and branches. You can find steps to set this up [here](http://code-worrier.com/blog/autocomplete-git/) or here in [my bash profile](https://github.com/nickpalenchar/swanked-out-bash).\n\nI love these commands. They've solved common problems quickly, and  have largley improved my overall git competency. Do you have any git commands/tricks you've found to be time-saving? fool-proofing? life-changing!?

No doubt I've felt it in tech and elsewhere in life, as I'm sure you have. While there's plenty of [articles](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/working-in-tech/imposter-syndrome) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whyUPLJZljE) on how to fight the self-doubt that comes along with Imposter Syndrome, I'd like to offer an alternative approach:\n\n_Use it._\n\nYou can try to fight Impostor Syndrome or change your mindset, and doing so has worked for some people. Not me. Instead, I use Impostor Syndrome as a primary motivation to learn new and difficult skills. For me, the recognition that I am currently uncomfortable and filled with self-doubt drives me to obliterate those feelings by means of mastery. Not only can Impostor Syndrome be a motivator, but it can also be a validator; **I keep on working for as long as it takes until the feeling of Impostor Syndrome isn't there anymore.**\n\n# Impostor Syndrome as a Motivator\n\nIt's well recognized that Impostor Syndrome is not necessarily a bad thing. In many ways, it can signal that you care about the work you are doing. While I try to eliminate it through mastery when experienced, the complete absence of Impostor Syndrome can be a signal that you are probably in the wrong field or focusing on the wrong thing. In these situation, I take a hard an honest look about why I _really_ want to learn something.\n\nConversely, the feeling of Impostor Syndrome is often the first step to in rewarding self-growth. Where there's feelings of doubt in a certain area, there are often feelings of success and gratifications if we stay the course. As a rule, whenever resistance is felt in a certain area, that's exactly the direction you should go in, and turning the obstacle (Impostor Syndrome) into a motivator has been the best way for me to prioritize what I should focus on. If this doesn't happen naturally, you can start by changing mindset. Simply change the way you define Impostor Syndrome, from:\n\n> Obstacle: I feel like an imposter and therefore should not be doing what I am currently doing.\n\nTo:\n\n> Motivation: I feel like an imposter and therefore should _learn more_ about what I am currently doing.\n\nUnderstand that avoiding Imposter Syndrome altogether results in being stuck in your comfort zone. Although you've successfully blocked out self-doubt, you've also blocked out self-growth and self-satisfaction in the process. No good!\n\n# What does \"beating\" imposter syndrome look like?\n\nOne thing I love about the tech industry is the quantifiable skills. When you know something, you can prove your worth again in again. I've beaten my own \"beginner\" Impostor Syndrome by building API's, certifying with Amazon Web Services, architecting infrastructure that remains stable, and receiving positive feedback on all my technical interviews in the past year. The best result is not only do I feel a strong sense of accomplishment, but I'm wildly confident in what I know. This is also known as conscious competence, the final phase of learning, and it feels great! \n\nConfidence should not be mistaken with arrogance, however. I'm also wildly confident about _what I don't know_. I try to be the first to admit I don't understand something--it's easy for me to do now because I am secure enough in my areas of expertise that I can acknowledge when something is beyond it. Furthermore, I view these new things as a way to expand my skills even more!\n\n# Important subtleties to note\n\nThis article is very work-your-ass-off oriented, but it's equally important to take breaks and make sure your work does not consume your entire life (see \"burnout\").\n\nAfter I achieve a huge goal, I always take a--sometimes extended--amount of time for some serious rest-and-recovery. Maybe it's my work-hard-play-hard nature, but I'm a big fan of drilling down three months at a time followed handful more of steady work with days off and lots of Netflix (or hiking) in between. And of course, when preparing for the next round of hard work, I ensure I'm fully recovered and mentally prepared for the new tasks ahead. A war is more than just the battle and you can't always be fighting it; there's lots of preparation and recovery needed to ensure you're at peak performance before the actual charge begins.\n\nI hope you've enjoyed my two cents on Impostor Syndrome. As a post script I'll admit that writing this article made me feel like a bit of... a fraud (so meta!).

Not only can Impostor Syndrome be a motivator, but it can also be a validator; \u003Cstrong>I keep on working for as long as it takes until the feeling of Impostor Syndrome isn’t there anymore.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"impostor-syndrome-as-a-motivator\">Impostor Syndrome as a Motivator\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>It’s well recognized that Impostor Syndrome is not necessarily a bad thing. In many ways, it can signal that you care about the work you are doing. While I try to eliminate it through mastery when experienced, the complete absence of Impostor Syndrome can be a signal that you are probably in the wrong field or focusing on the wrong thing. In these situation, I take a hard an honest look about why I \u003Cem>really\u003C/em> want to learn something.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Conversely, the feeling of Impostor Syndrome is often the first step to in rewarding self-growth. Where there’s feelings of doubt in a certain area, there are often feelings of success and gratifications if we stay the course. As a rule, whenever resistance is felt in a certain area, that’s exactly the direction you should go in, and turning the obstacle (Impostor Syndrome) into a motivator has been the best way for me to prioritize what I should focus on. If this doesn’t happen naturally, you can start by changing mindset.

When you know something, you can prove your worth again in again. I’ve beaten my own “beginner” Impostor Syndrome by building API’s, certifying with Amazon Web Services, architecting infrastructure that remains stable, and receiving positive feedback on all my technical interviews in the past year. The best result is not only do I feel a strong sense of accomplishment, but I’m wildly confident in what I know.

And of course, when preparing for the next round of hard work, I ensure I’m fully recovered and mentally prepared for the new tasks ahead.

I read the [Tech Crunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code/). I read the [FreeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/please-do-learn-to-code-233597dd141c#.f86wmzk61) article. For good measure, I also read the [Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/) article mentioned by the FreeCodeCamp article. My reaction? They all have valid points and are all worth reading. I don’t think these articles are in direct conflict with each other as we might have believed them to be.\n\n## The Case for Teaching Coding in Schools\n\nFirst, let’s address a recurring theme in these conversations: integrating computer science into school curricula. This topic, while related, often gets conflated with the broader question of whether individuals should pursue coding professionally.\n\nTeaching programming in schools is not about turning every student into a software engineer. The true goal is exposure. Just as not every student who learns algebra becomes a mathematician, programming education equips students with foundational skills and opens doors to those who discover a passion for it. The argument against teaching coding because not every student will use it professionally misses the point of education entirely.\n\nProgramming is increasingly as essential as reading or arithmetic in today’s world. Basic coding literacy can empower students to navigate and understand technology, regardless of their career paths. Let’s make it part of the curriculum—there’s nothing to lose.\n\n## Coding as a Career: A Reality Check\n\nShould you learn to code to build a career? Here, the skeptics—the “don’t learn to code” advocates—make some critical points. Programming is a challenging field, requiring constant learning, problem-solving, and perseverance. It’s not something you master through a three-month bootcamp or a handful of online courses. While bootcamps and platforms like Codecademy are great starting points, they’re just that: starting points.\n\nPursuing programming as a career demands resilience and a genuine passion for the craft. The work can be frustrating and, at times, overwhelming. Success in this field often comes down to persistence—an intrinsic drive to solve problems and create.\n\n## The Value of Coding Literacy\n\nEven if programming isn’t your career goal, learning to code offers undeniable benefits. Consider the oft-used analogy comparing programming to plumbing. While you may never become a professional plumber, understanding the basics can save you time and money when addressing minor issues at home. Similarly, coding skills can help you:\n- Write a simple script to automate repetitive tasks.\n- Customize tools to suit your needs.\n- Understand how websites and software work at a fundamental level.\n- These skills are increasingly valuable in a world where technology permeates every industry.\n\n## The Takeaway?\n\nBoth sides of this debate offer important lessons. From the skeptics, we learn that programming is a demanding profession requiring dedication. The “hype” surrounding coding should not obscure the reality of the hard work involved. Those drawn to coding for its perceived glamour may find themselves quickly disillusioned.\n\nFrom the advocates, we’re reminded that coding is not magic. It’s a learnable, teachable skill accessible to anyone willing to put in the effort. The rise of initiatives like code.org and FreeCodeCamp has demystified programming, making it more approachable for those eager to explore the field.\n\nFor me, this movement was transformative. In high school, I dabbled in programming by building video games with tools like GameMaker. At the time, a career in software engineering felt unattainable. However, initiatives promoting coding literacy helped me see a path forward. Today, I dedicate countless hours to honing my craft, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nWhether your goal is to pursue programming professionally or simply to gain a better understanding of the digital world, learning to code is a worthwhile endeavor.

I'll reach out to my network of bootcamp grads, asking for resumes, hoping I can get them a job at a great company.\n\nI end up throwing out 99% of them every time.\n\nThe reason is always the same: their GitHub has half a year or much more of total radio silence.\n\nIf there's one piece of advice I could shout from the rooftops, especially to new devs, is that an active GitHub is probably your best competitive advantage to getting an interview or referral cold.\n\nIt's not a perfect system. But it's the system we have. And it never fully made sense to me until I found myself on the receiving end of resumes, with more to go through than time I had available.\n\nSimply put, most resumes with equal experience look the same. New bootcamp grads went to a bootcamp and did a couple of projects (that may or may not be hosted). Those with two years of experience have a company they've worked for, maybe two. And everyone is listing similar languages and technologies they use.\n\nIt's a start, but then I'm left with 5-10 resumes and 1-3 referrals I can comfortably make. At this point I could paste them to a wall and throw a dart. Or I could look at their GitHub.\n\n## Getting your Github ready without loosing sleep\n\nYou can easily increase your candidacy with an active GitHub but **you don't need to go crazy either**. Please don't [Eat-Sleep-Code-Repeat](https://medium.com/@iamtjah/eat-sleep-code-repeat-please-dont-f1453659d703). Simply doing bare minimum places you stratospherically above most others. So here's some simple ways to do just that:\n\n* **Set up some [dotfiles](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/command-line/#dotfiles)** - Effortlessly save your configuration. And whenever you add to it, you get a 🟩. I use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).\n* Whenever you take a class, or code through a book, **put that code on GitHub** - You don't need to author an open source library. Simple code snippets or notes in markdown are great! Put your LeetCode solutions up there too while you're at it. Don't let all the stuff you're already doing collect dust. Get those 🟩s!\n* **[Host your website statically on GitHub](https://pages.github.com/).** - If you have a portfolio, every new thing you add is a 🟩. If you host a blog, new posts are new 🟩. [My website/blog](https://nickpalenchar.com) is hosted [this way](https://github.com/nickpalenchar/nickpalenchar) with [AstroJS](https://astro.build).\n\nIt will be very, very unlikely a hiring manager will look at your actual commits. Simply having anything up there is what matters. It shows you walk the walk and talk the talk. It immediately proves you have basic knowledge of the same version control they are definitely using at work.\n\nAnd again you don't even need to go overboard in frequency. Your 🟩s can be sprinkled like cayenne on a dish that shouldn't be too spicy. But it should not look completely and totally abandoned for the year.\n\n## Reversal \n\nI think an active GitHub is the easiest way to give you a competitive advantage, but there are alternatives if they are your thing. Among them, you could:\n\n* **Be an active blogger** - Personally, [I don't like doing this](https://nickpalenchar.com/worst-blogging-advice/).

I spent the day meeting engineers from every department, and was asked to whiteboard solutions to many problems. Some were very mathmatical algorithms, others were architectures for things like microservices and AWS. Among the questions, my favorite was making a URL shortener, similar to bit.ly.\n\n```\nTHE CHALLENGE\nDesign a URL shortener app. It should have a dashboard for users that can submit a link to be shortened. The app will generate a shortened version (using its own domain) that would redirect to the URL when navigated to.\n\nEXAMPLE\nSubmitting www.averylonglink.com/with/additional/routes would produce shortener.io/ohk4 (or something like that). Navigating to shortener.io/ohk4 would load www.averylonglink.com/with/additional/routes.\n```\n\nThere was no coding, or talk of specific technologies. However, fast-forward to 8 months later, we have a chosen stack and a deployed app.\n\n![](http://www.nickpalenserve.us/public/images/palento_home.png \"The home page.\")\n\n---\n\n![](http://www.nickpalenserve.us/public/images/palento_dashboard.png \"The dashboard.\")\n\nThe end result is palen-to (The first two syllables of my last name, and the .to TLD).\n\nMost of the original considerations from the interview room went into the implementation (with more on the way). Among these were:\n\n+ A way to randomly generate a URL.\n+ A way to ensure all URLs are unique.\n+ A way to make custom shortened URL names.\n+ A way to preview potentially malicious redirects (planned)\n\nBecause Palen-to is branded with my last name, I'm only allowing signups from family members that share it. So I've since built in the following feature:\n\n+ Sign-up restricted to whitelisted individuals.\n\n## How it's made.\n\nI've built a minimal implementation as a fullstack javascript application. Here's the stack with some pertinent technologies:\n\n+ Static HTML \\[Frontend]\n  + Bootstrap 3 components (minimal)\n+ Node/expressJS \\[Server]\n  + [Swig](http://node-swig.github.io/swig-templates) rendering.\n+ MongoDB \\[Database]\n\nThat's it! Simple, no?\n\n### Setting up redirect routes.\n\nObviously, the name of the game is looking up dynamic shortened routes and redirecting to a specified longer URL. But that's not the _only_ thing this app should do. Like any well-designed app, this one should have a dashboard and functional routes that allow users to create redirects. These _static_ (or hard-coded, pre-defined) routes should _not_ cause a redirect but instead render our own internal views or api functionality.\n\nSo let's start by defining some views:\n\n```\n/           -> Landing Page/login\n/dashboard  -> Swig-rendered list of redirect routes made, and a field to make new ones.\n/error      -> Rendering of errors\n/api/*      -> Namespace for different api routes, to allow things like a POST request for making new urls\n/:redirect  -> All the rest will attempt to lookup and redirect a short route to a url.\n```\n\n\nIt's important to node re: Express, that the order of these routes are _very important_. In general, important/static routes should go first, and dynamic/general routes should go second/last. Express will trigger middlewere the first time it's match. Take this simple example.\n\n```javascript\n\napp.get('/:redirectURL', (req, res) => res.status(308).send('this would be the redirect'));\n\napp.get('/dashboard', (req, res) => res.status(200).send('got the dashboard!');\n\n```\n\nSince the first route is a param (preceeded by a `:`), the route would act as a wild card, catching any named route, _including_ dashboard. If you tried to get to your actual dashboard, we would be intercepted by a redirect lookup every time!\n\nWe can reverse these without the inverse being true, however. If `/dashboard` came first, any top level route that wasn't `/dashboard` would skip that middleware and eventually find its way to the redirect lookup.\n\nIn the full example, all of these pre-defined routes should go before the redirectURL.\n\n### Creating and looking up redirect links.\n\nEnough planning, let's dive into the main course: the actual shortening of the links. I've opensourced Palen-to into a generic app ready for cloning and deploying, called [https://github.com/nickpalencharopen/tinytiny](TinyTiny). I'll refer to the code there when going into detail about the app, but will refer to the domain where my version is deployed to: [palen.to](https://palen.to). Feel free to clone the opensource version and follow along, or view on GitHub!\n\n#### Data model.\n\nThere's only one important data model here, the `Link`. Every url gets shortened to a unique route in the app, such as `'abc'` in `palen.to/abc`. And that identifier has a one-to-one relation with the expanded url. Both these\n\n\nAssuming the request is not a reserved route (such as `palen.to/dashboard`), we should look up the document in the data model by that route. There we can find the full URL to direct to. In the data model, we have the following values:\n\n+ **link_id**: The shortened link (`abc` in `palen.to/abc`). Also serves as the unique id for the document (looking up documents by the native Mongo `_id` is not nescessary).\n+ **expandedUrl**: The full url that the shortened route is supposed to redirect to (i.e. `www.nickpalenchar.com`).\n\nAdditionally, we'll add some meta data to the model. Knowing the user that made the shortened link is always helpful for getting list of links for a logged in user, and auditing purposes. A creation date is always a good idea as well.\n\nThe full schema of the Link model looks like this! ([view on github](https://github.com/nickpalencharOpen/tinytiny/blob/master/models/link.js)):\n\n```javascript\nlet mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nlet LinkSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n    link_id: {type: String, unique: true, required: true},\n    expandedUrl: String,\n    author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },\n    creationDate: { type: Date, default: Date.now }\n});\n\nmongoose.model('Link', LinkSchema);\n```\n\nGetting a redirect route is a matter of finding a Link document by its `link_id`. If we get a document back, we can use the `expandedUrl` property for the redirection. Express makes redirects very easy, just call the `res.redirect` method and \"Bam!\", you get to your destination. If we can't find a document, we send back an internal 404.\n\n([view on github](https://github.com/nickpalencharOpen/tinytiny/blob/master/app.js#L121-L130))\n\n```javascript\n\napp.get('/:id', (req, res) => {\n    //@@~~**REDIRECTION TIME**~~@@\n    // THIS IS WHAT WE CAME HER FOR PPL1//\n    console.log(\"looking up \", req.params.id);\n    return Link.findOne({link_id: req.params.id})\n        .then(result => {\n            if(result) res.redirect(result.expandedUrl); // i.e. www.nickpalenchar.com\n            else res.redirect('/error?code=404'); // beginning with a slash will go to the error route within our app.\n        })\n});\n```\n\n\nCreating links is a bit more complicated, we need to consider:\n\n+ What characters can make up a shortened link\n+ How to prevent duplicate shortened links from being created\n+ How to allow custom shortened link names to override randomly created shortened link names, without conflicting with reserved routes.\n\nChoosing the allowed characters and randomly generating a shortened link name is a matter of a utility function:\n\n([view on github](https://github.com/nickpalencharOpen/tinytiny/blob/master/helper/index.js))\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports.randomHash = function(num=2) {\n    let validChars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789';\n    let result = '';\n\n    // loop through a number of times specfied when calling (`num`) creating a random string of that length.\n    for(let i = 0; i \u003C num; i++){\n        result += validChars[Math.floor(Math.random() * validChars.length)]; // concatonate a single random character\n    }\n    return result;\n};\n```\n\nI'm choosing to start my random shortened link names to be especially small, 2 characters long. I chose this because there will not be much scale in users (I'm restricting signups to my family, of which none of them are interested in using it ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯ ). Still, the possible combination of links will quickly fill up, with the chance of a duplicate being produced likely to happen faster still.\n\nWe need a way to both try again if the produced name is taken, and to _increase_ the possible number of available names, should the majority be taken.\n\n```javascript\nfunction tryLink(n=defaultStartLength, attempt=1){\n    // randomly tries to find an available link\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        let id = req.body.customName || randomHash(n); // only make a random name\n        return Link.find({link_id: id})\n            .then(result => {\n                if(result.length) {\n                    if(attempt > 100) reject({nick:true, error: \"Gave up finding an available link\", body: \"This might be solved \" +\n                    \"if you try again. If not, the admin might have to expand the algorithm. Wow this app grew quick!\"});\n                    else return tryLink(n+1, attempt+1);\n                }\n                if(reserved.includes(id.toLowerCase())){\n                    reject({ nick:true, error: \"Link is a reserved word\", body: \"You can't use that! Because programming needs. \" +\n                    \"Try something else. Please note that no uppercase version of the reserved word can be used either, \" +\n                    \"to avoid ambiguity.\"});\n                }\n                else return Link.create({link_id: id, expandedUrl, author: req.user._id})\n                    .then(result => resolve(result));\n            })\n    })\n}\n```\n\n\nThis function wraps a Promise around Mongo lookups, so when our api calls it, we can `.then` off it once, and the final result will be accessible for us to use.\n\nIt starts by storing a variable either by a customName (passed in from `req.body`, via a user input form), or a random name (using the util function described earlier).\n\nIn both cases we want to make sure the link isn't previously in use, by looking up a Link with `link_id` equal to the name in question. If there is _not_ any document returned, the name has no document and therefore is not in use. A final check is to make sure the name does not conflict with any reserved routes. Reserved routes are kept as an Array in a separate json file and `requireelif in (as `reserved`). We can use `Array.includes`, an ES2016 feature, can be used to make sure the name we came up with is not contained here.\n\nIf we find a result, we try again, recursively calling the function. By wraping the entire function in a Promise, and only invoking a resolve in a non-recursive, ending case, we can easily handle the asynchronous nature of Mongo lookups within our recursive calls. The recursive call also increments the length of the random name to generate by 1 _and_ keeps track of how many times it has been recursively called, using a second parameter left alone at the start. This is important--increasing the length after a failed attempt expands the available link names as the app scales, and keeping track of attempts allows me to add an additional fail-safe: to avoid running into, say, an infinite loop by means of something I might have overlooked, we break and error out after the 100th attempt.\n\n\nThe full middleware for this is described below:\n\n([view on github](https://github.com/nickpalencharOpen/tinytiny/blob/master/routes/api.js#L17-L53))\n\n\n```javascript\nrouter.post('/new-link', requireAuthentication ,(req, res) => {\n    let { expandedUrl, customName } = req.body;\n    if(!/^https?:\\/\\//.test(expandedUrl)) expandedUrl = \"http://\" + expandedUrl; // add `http://` if not already provided, for consistency.\n\n    tryLink()\n        .then(result => {\n            res.redirect('/dashboard?success=' + JSON.stringify(result));\n        })\n        .catch( err => {\n            if(err.nick) res.render('error', {err} );\n            else res.redirect('/error?code=1');\n        })\n});\n```\n\nWith these two features in place, you have a minimal app that creates fun little links to easily send around! There's is of course a lot more to this app besides this core feature. Getting into the project will show a lot of additional design for the front end views, authentication/user restriction, security, and so much more. While these two aspects are critical to the app's use, it only scratches the the very top surface in terms of how the app is made. If you really want to level up your coding skills, I would be honored if you checkd out the [open source project](https://www.github.com/nickpalencharOpen/tinytiny) and consider getting involved.

This is important—increasing the length after a failed attempt expands the available link names as the app scales, and keeping track of attempts allows me to add an additional fail-safe: to avoid running into, say, an infinite loop by means of something I might have overlooked, we break and error out after the 100th attempt.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The full middleware for this is described below:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>(\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/nickpalencharOpen/tinytiny/blob/master/routes/api.js#L17-L53\">view on github\u003C/a>)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8;

It was the culmination many years of curbing my reliance on addictive technology (not to mention the atrocious leadership and terrible practices Meta constantly employs). Since then (and even before) I've had many conversations with people about Instagram, which most often goes a certain way: They don't like instagram, they want to be off it, but...\n\nThere's always a *\"but\"*.\n\nI've been sympathetic to the fact that social media can provide genuine value to your personal and professional life, which makes it feel like a necessary evil (by design!). But unfortunately, none of these reasons are good enough to stay on Instagram.\n\nNow that I'm fully removed from the app myself, I've started to feel more compelled to start calling bullshit on all the reasons why others are still part of Meta (yes I'm great at parties).\n\n### Staying in touch with friends\n\nI remember reconnecting with an old classmate because I discovered we were both visiting Acadia national park at the same time. I only knew this because I noticed her geo-tagged story. I won't have that coincidence again now that I'm off of Instagram. I also have friends who are much more likely to respond on Instagram than on a text.\n\nBut here's the hard truth: friends that are worth your while will text you. And you will reach out to friends that are truly worth your time to ask about what they've been up to. And for how cool it was to be able to use Instagram as way to serendipitously find myself near my old classmate, that was one benefit among what would probably be hundreds to thousands of hours wasting my time, connecting with no one. So from a cost/benefit analysis, cutting this off is a net positive.\n\nMeta themselves have actually agued they are [no longer social media apps](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-reveals-decline-friend-content-instagram-facebook-amid-ftc-trial-2025-4), citing most users spend just 7% of their time actually viewing content from people they know!\n\n### Business Prospects\n\nThis is harder, sure. Many businesses are on Instagram, where it can be very easy to connect with a potentially large set of users.\n\nMy view is honestly quite similar to the friends argument, which is centered on the principle that humans can always find a solution with the tools they've been given. Sourcing leads on instagram could very well be the easiest solution for a business. But if you take that away, you will then be forced to find what the next easiest solution is (one which you may never have seen if you're on Instagram and default to that.)\n\nIf that really doesn't seem feasible, the recommendation is to really *just use it for business*, which is harder than it sounds. However social media tools like HootSuite can assist with being more removed from the addictive parts of the app. Having Instagram on a second phone (your \"work phone\") is another pretty good solution. If it doesn't seem worth paying for a social media management tool or using your old phone to use Instagram, then perhaps go back to the first point on finding alternate ways to connect/advertise with your user base off the platform.","src/content/posts/Your reasons for staying on Instagram are bullshit.md","e83d16c64fc52509",{"html":864,"metadata":865},"\u003Cp>I fully deleted my Instagram at the start of 2025.

So from a cost/benefit analysis, cutting this off is a net positive.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Meta themselves have actually agued they are \u003Ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-reveals-decline-friend-content-instagram-facebook-amid-ftc-trial-2025-4\">no longer social media apps\u003C/a>, citing most users spend just 7% of their time actually viewing content from people they know!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"business-prospects\">Business Prospects\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This is harder, sure. Many businesses are on Instagram, where it can be very easy to connect with a potentially large set of users.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My view is honestly quite similar to the friends argument, which is centered on the principle that humans can always find a solution with the tools they’ve been given. Sourcing leads on instagram could very well be the easiest solution for a business. But if you take that away, you will then be forced to find what the next easiest solution is (one which you may never have seen if you’re on Instagram and default to that.)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If that really doesn’t seem feasible, the recommendation is to really \u003Cem>just use it for business\u003C/em>, which is harder than it sounds. However social media tools like HootSuite can assist with being more removed from the addictive parts of the app. Having Instagram on a second phone (your “work phone”) is another pretty good solution. If it doesn’t seem worth paying for a social media management tool or using your old phone to use Instagram, then perhaps go back to the first point on finding alternate ways to connect/advertise with your user base off the platform.\u003C/p>",{"headings":866,"localImagePaths":873,"remoteImagePaths":874,"frontmatter":875,"imagePaths":878},[867,870],{"depth":70,"slug":868,"text":869},"staying-in-touch-with-friends","Staying in touch with friends",{"depth":70,"slug":871,"text":872},"business-prospects","Business Prospects",[],[],{"title":857,"date":876,"description":499,"tags":877,"external":18,"draft":19,"minutesRead":631},["Date","2025-12-13T00:00:00.000Z"],[594],[],"notes---jobs-and-the-deep-life",{"id":879,"data":881,"body":885,"filePath":886,"digest":887,"rendered":888},{"title":882,"date":883,"description":499,"tags":884,"external":18,"draft":18},"Notes: Jobs and The Deep Life (Cal Newport)",["Date","2026-01-24T00:00:00.000Z"],[594],"These are my personal notes on the podcas [Jobs and the Deep Life (Cal Newport)](https://www.thedeeplife.com/podcasts/episodes/ep-320-jobs-and-the-deep-life/)\n\n## 4 Paradoxes of Work\n\n### \\#1. The Passion Paradox\n\nThe time-old advice that if you just follow your passion, everything will work out.\n\n|Expectation|Reality|\n|-----------|-------|\n|Work won't even feel like work because it is also what you're truly passionate about.|Day-to-Day of pretty much all jobs are pretty similar (spreadsheets, email, coding. Read: mundane)|\n\n### \\#2: Grand Goal Paradox\n\nThe idea that if you just get to a very prestigious level in your work you'll be happy.\n\n|Expectation|Reality|\n|-----------|-------|\n|Highly regarded in you field garantees job security, allows you to work the way you'd want to.|Pursuit of \"Grand Goals\" trample other important life areas; accomplishment is rewarded with more work/stress|\n\n### \\#3 FU Money Paradox\n\nMany of us understand the idea of having FU Money, which allows you to say \"Fuck you\" to whomever you want (like your boss), because you are so weathly you no longer depend on having a job.\n\n|Expectation|Reality|\n|-----------|-------|\n|You will never have to answer to anyone.|Actually achieving this is unrealistic for most, is only even possible in a small number of professions, and ofter requires large sacrifices such as your health & relationships. Even if you were to achieve FU money status, there is a lot of positives about being in a fulfilling career that FU money removes.|\n\n### \\#4. The Bohemian Paradox\n\nThe idea that W2 Jobs suck the life out of you, that instead you should just do a bunch of freelance work and short-term gigs. (in many ways, the opposite of the FU paradox)\n\n|Expectation|Reality|\n|-----------|-------|\n|You'll be happier, have maximum flexibility, and not stressed over a single source of income.|You can become more stressed by giving up many of those same W2 benefits, which are quite good for quality of life (expected income in regular intervals, health insurance)|\n\n## The Alternative way to think about work\n\nThe first step is to really **understand what kind of life you want**, which Cal refers to as [Lifestyle-Centric Planning](https://calnewport.com/the-most-important-piece-of-career-advice-you-probably-never-heard-2/). And come up with a number--the amount of money you need to achieve this (I think of it as a yearly salary, which includes saving enough such that my net worth also grows year over year).\n\nFrom there, first invest in skills and career capital in order to get to the number you set, and then begin trading higher income for more flexibility/time/whatever helps achieve the life you set out for yourself.\n\n## Job a a Tool\n\nWhen thinking of places to work, it's useful to asses Them based on 3 criteria:\n\n1. How much money it generates\n1. How much time it requires\n1. How much flexibility it provides you\n\nDepending on your values, as well as other life events, there may be different priorities for each of these attributes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is one of my favorite podcasts of all time. I find myself especially referencing it whenever someone is feeling unsatisfied with their jobs or directionless about where they want to be next. The understanding of the Four Paradoxes is especially helpful in thinking more realistically and less romantically about jobs and their use.","src/content/posts/Notes - Jobs and the Deep Life.md","3ccce91252ab51d5",{"html":889,"metadata":890},"\u003Cp>These are my personal notes on the podcas \u003Ca href=\"https://www.thedeeplife.com/podcasts/episodes/ep-320-jobs-and-the-deep-life/\">Jobs and the Deep Life (Cal Newport)\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"4-paradoxes-of-work\">4 Paradoxes of Work\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"1-the-passion-paradox\">#1.
