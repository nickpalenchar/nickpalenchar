As social media has evolved, I've noticed a strange phenomenon: we aren't bored
anymore, ever. Even 3 seconds silent time can be filled with a "quick glance"
at your phone, where you can consume a 3 second tik tok. Our brains are
getting wired to think faster and faster, and our ability to focus is
completely disappearing.

But the real tragedy is that our online lives are completely replacing
in-person social connection, a vital component of our basic instincts.

This constant stimulation and the replacement of real-world interactions with digital connections are reshaping how we think, feel, and engage with the world. Digital minimalism offers a way to reclaim our focus, rebuild meaningful connections, and live more intentionally in a noisy, fast-paced digital age. If this resonates with you, explore the principles and resources below to start your journey toward a more mindful relationship with technology.


## The Main Tenets of Digital Minimalism

**Be Intentional**. Use technology only when it aligns with your values and goals. Don’t let tech use be passive or habitual.

**Declutter Ruthlessly**. Identify apps, platforms, and tools that don’t serve you, and remove them. Less is more.

**Focus on Value**. Prioritize tools and habits that provide meaningful benefits. Avoid activities that waste time or drain energy.

**Embrace Analog Activities**. Spend more time on offline activities that bring joy—reading, exercising, socializing, or pursuing hobbies.

**Set Boundaries**. Establish clear rules for when and how you use technology to protect your time and attention.
