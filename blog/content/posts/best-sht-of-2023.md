My annual Drop of the best articles and other interesting things I've found on the internets in 2022. Mostly Developer focused.

_Note: These are not necessarily things published in 2023, but the things I've discovered._

## Best Articles

- [A Career Ending Mistake](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/career) - (Not what it sounds like) the importance of consciously
deciding what career you want to end up in, and how to get there... while you still have time.
- [Numbers To Know For Managing (Software Teams)](https://web.archive.org/web/20230322100209/https://staysaasy.com/management/2023/03/20/numbers-to-manage-by.html) love it
- [Testing a new encrypted messaging app's extraordinary claims](https://web.archive.org/web/20230511084005/https://crnkovic.dev/testing-converso/) A really fascinating tale of reverse engineering. The Author walks through fairly trivial ways
you can find out about an app from its source code. Tl;dr: you can learn a lot from the domain names code calls out to!


## Best Podcast Episode

- [How to launder $600 million on the internet](https://www.npr.org/2023/09/15/1197954055/axie-infinity-north-korea-ronin) - I'm notoriously not into
true crime. But cyber crime? Fascinating! This podcast episode interviews the investigator tasked with recovering $600 Million in stolen crypto.

## Other cool sh*t

- [Kagi Search](https://kagi.com) - Paid search engine that's blazingly fast with no ads.
I'm super excited to see this alternative revenue being tested. Kagi will be one of the first case studies
for an internet beyond Surveillance Capitalism.
