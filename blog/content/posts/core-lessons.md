## Consistency > Intensity

I've heard this idea many times in many different ways, going back to as far as the Greeks ("If you add a little to a little, and then doi it again, soon that little shall be much.")

A similar idea in the reverse is seen at the core of Engineering--we break down large, complex problems down into many little pieces, then slowly and dilligently hack at each one. With consisteny, all those small things add up.

This applies to literally anything worth doing: working out, learning a new language, eating better. Running is one of the best examples, as there's not too many fancy things you can do (you're either running or you're not). The act of running on a consistent weekly schedule slowly builds up your cardio.

## If you chase two rabbits at the same time, you will end up catching neither.

This is hard lesson for me, who very much enjoys exploring new things. But this concept was absolutely crucial when I began learning to code--It was in the form of advice from freeCodeCamp that "you've got to focus" when first starting out (in this case, it was focus on just learning JavaScript, without frameworks and ignoring any other languages). Learning to code is particuarly difficult because there's so many ways you can approach it. But in many ways it doesn't matter where you start so long as you understand your entrypoint deeply.
