"Please Learn to Code." "Please don't learn to code." The debate about whether everyone should learn to code is as polarizing as it is perennial. I read the [Tech Crunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code/). I read the [FreeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/please-do-learn-to-code-233597dd141c#.f86wmzk61) article. For good measure, I also read the [Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/) article mentioned by the FreeCodeCamp article. My reaction? They all have valid points and are all worth reading. I don’t think these articles are in direct conflict with each other as we might have believed them to be.

## The Case for Teaching Coding in Schools

First, let’s address a recurring theme in these conversations: integrating computer science into school curricula. This topic, while related, often gets conflated with the broader question of whether individuals should pursue coding professionally.

Teaching programming in schools is not about turning every student into a software engineer. The true goal is exposure. Just as not every student who learns algebra becomes a mathematician, programming education equips students with foundational skills and opens doors to those who discover a passion for it. The argument against teaching coding because not every student will use it professionally misses the point of education entirely.

Programming is increasingly as essential as reading or arithmetic in today’s world. Basic coding literacy can empower students to navigate and understand technology, regardless of their career paths. Let’s make it part of the curriculum—there’s nothing to lose.

## Coding as a Career: A Reality Check

Should you learn to code to build a career? Here, the skeptics—the “don’t learn to code” advocates—make some critical points. Programming is a challenging field, requiring constant learning, problem-solving, and perseverance. It’s not something you master through a three-month bootcamp or a handful of online courses. While bootcamps and platforms like Codecademy are great starting points, they’re just that: starting points.

Pursuing programming as a career demands resilience and a genuine passion for the craft. The work can be frustrating and, at times, overwhelming. Success in this field often comes down to persistence—an intrinsic drive to solve problems and create.

## The Value of Coding Literacy

Even if programming isn’t your career goal, learning to code offers undeniable benefits. Consider the oft-used analogy comparing programming to plumbing. While you may never become a professional plumber, understanding the basics can save you time and money when addressing minor issues at home. Similarly, coding skills can help you:
- Write a simple script to automate repetitive tasks.
- Customize tools to suit your needs.
- Understand how websites and software work at a fundamental level.
- These skills are increasingly valuable in a world where technology permeates every industry.

## The Takeaway?

Both sides of this debate offer important lessons. From the skeptics, we learn that programming is a demanding profession requiring dedication. The “hype” surrounding coding should not obscure the reality of the hard work involved. Those drawn to coding for its perceived glamour may find themselves quickly disillusioned.

From the advocates, we’re reminded that coding is not magic. It’s a learnable, teachable skill accessible to anyone willing to put in the effort. The rise of initiatives like code.org and FreeCodeCamp has demystified programming, making it more approachable for those eager to explore the field.

For me, this movement was transformative. In high school, I dabbled in programming by building video games with tools like GameMaker. At the time, a career in software engineering felt unattainable. However, initiatives promoting coding literacy helped me see a path forward. Today, I dedicate countless hours to honing my craft, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

Whether your goal is to pursue programming professionally or simply to gain a better understanding of the digital world, learning to code is a worthwhile endeavor. The key is to approach it with clear expectations and a willingness to embrace the challenges ahead.
