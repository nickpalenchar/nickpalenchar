If you're as old as I am, you might remember the days of early Facebook. There were a few occasional "chain posts" that would circulate virally. One of the more common ones that used to come across my feed was a warning that Mark Zuckerberg would start charging for Facebook. My memory is hazy, but I think you had to share the post to "sign" a petition to keep Facebook free? Whatever it was, the posts spread pretty widely, with many users commenting about how they would never pay.

I never thought Facebook was going to be a paid product, because we pay with something much more valuable, our data.

I'm not going to get on a soap box about data privacy and its value and how many citizens don't respect or value it, because I think we're starting to get the point. We've seen large social media platforms engineer our attention and emotions into additiction, which it was only able to achieve by closely montioring our daily habits, down to the millisecond. Since the boom of AI, there's now real concern about our content we've willingly added to these platforms--writing, artwork, selfies, location data--being molested and repurposed without our consent, in order to create massive value, of which the original authors will never benefit from.

If you don't pay for a product, *you are the product*. Platforms we use for free come at a real cost: our data, our attention, our addiction. And since their main source of income are these things, decisions made will not necessarily benefit the end user, at least not in the way you might have wanted.

But there is also a wave of products out there that have no algorithm or less of an algorithm. These products are, admittedly, miles behind the engineering power that big tech can afford. But they can fill a niche. If you find yourself using one of these products, you should absolutely pay for it (even if there's a free version).

## Products I Pay For

### PI.FYI

This is the closest thing I have to social media. It's an algorithm-less, "recommendation" platform. Get recs, make recs, ask for recs. It's simple, non-distracting, and harkens back to the days of the old internet.

### Letterboxd

It's movies! I keep track of movie I want to see and have seen, and connect with some friends to see their recs. I pay for pro, even though I don't use any of the pro features.

### Obsidian Sync

This one is a no-brainer for me. I use obsidian to [blog](My%20Blog%20Workflow%20-%202025.md) (as well as journal, task track, and just about any type of brainstorm). Since the editor is open source and saves documents as markdown, there's a lot of free ways you could "sync" your files across devices (popular ways include git and dropbox). But Obsidian Sync is objectively the easiest as it *just works*. Now I blog on my mac and pick it up on my iPad, or even iPhone.

### iCloud

Apple is a great product. The more I buy into their ecosystem, the more I appreciate how convenient everything is. And while Apple is certainly not an example of a company that's short on cash, I value the quality in their products, both hardware and software. Most recently I've especially loved their family plan, because my dear old mother loves *being* on the family plan.
