My annual Drop of the best articles and other interesting things I've found on the internets in 2021. Mostly Developer focused.

_Note: These are not necessarily things published in 2021, but the things I've discovered._

## Best Articles
- **[Programming is Hard](https://dorinlazar.ro/2021-02-programming-is-hard/)** - Great writing on the misconception
that "anyone" can learn to code (much better said than [my own writing on the matter](/post/please-maybe-learn-to-code/)). I continue to recommend everyone thinking about learning to code take stock of the rewards as well as the challenges it involves.
- **[The XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/)** - We spend lots of time as developers asking for help. Learning the best way makes your life (and your team's) so much better and brighter.
- **[The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/)** - Simple 12 yes/no questions every new team/management should ask
themselves when setting up a project. Also contains a few nuggets of interesting coding history.

## Best Workflow Improvements
- I learned VSCode, and started mapping out many of my own keyboard shortcuts. No articles about this (yet), sorry!

## Best Online Course

- Nothing turned up this year, so check out the best sh*t from [earlier](/best-sht-of-2020#best-online-course)
