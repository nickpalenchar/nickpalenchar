Rather than hoarding a "Best Sh\*t" of blog post at the very end of the year like I usually do, I'm trying something new _

## Things I liked

📺 [My 5 simple steps to eat healthier in 2026](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAqpihEKaXM) This year I started to really get conscious about [The Diet](The%20Diet.md)

[How I ship Projects At Big Tech Companies](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship/) - TODO tldr shipping is *hard* but it's also what we are paid for. The best strategy to thrive in your career is to have a ship-first mindset

## Things I'm adding

justthebrowser.com - simple way to remove all "non-browser" features from Chorme/Firefox/Edge (adware, AI feature, etc).

## Things I'm Removing

### Less common browsers

*(disclosure: I currently work at Atlassian, which recently acquired the company that makes Arc Browser, mentioned below)*

I really like the concept of Android phones, because they are more customizable and hackable. But long ago I switched to the iPhone because it just works. I'm feeling the same about browsers.

I gave up on Arc for Zen last year, but now moving on from Zen as I'm starting to notice buggy behavior—Seems like memory leaks, or maybe it's just a memory hog? I don't know, and I don't want to give myself a second engineering job trying to figure that one out.

I'm going back to Chrome (with the aforementioned justthebrowser.com profile)
