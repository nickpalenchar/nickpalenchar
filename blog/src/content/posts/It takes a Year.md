Start writing...*This was a post I had in mind for way back in 2017, when I was first breaking into tech (and Aerial Arts). It was written for primarily an audience at a time when coding bootcamps and the "Learn to Code" movement was at it's peak. This was a time when we all became convinced that 3 months was all it took to become a software engineer. While we've all since developed a healthy skepticism with that exact practice, I find this post to still be relevant (and it will be great to finally evict these musings that have been living in my head rent-free for the past 8 years.*

I started doing Aerial Silks at the beginning of 2017. After going to a college where many peers in the arts practiced semi-professionally, I wanted to give it a try. The instant I got into my first foot-lock and climbed up what felt like nothing but a curtain, I was hooked.

The beginning was pretty difficult. I felt my forearm muscles bulging and crying out in a way I had never experienced, often at the start of a few climbs. More advanced climbs that required hooking the silk with you knee while upside down seemed almost impossible. But I kept going because it was just too fun. And things got better. I could do those upside down climes in repetition not before long.

It wasn't just going, it was going consistently. I pretty much never missed a week for a year. And not too long after, on 2018, I did my [first Aerial performance](https://vimeo.com/343009625), suspended in the air for about 3½ minutes.

## It Takes a Year

It's no mystery to many that anything worth doing that's impressive requires a lot of practice. The phrase I like to say these days however, is "it takes year." It Takes a Year to be even a little bit good at anything worth doing. This is the threshold where you get to be a little bit dangerous, a little bit competent, just good enough that you can show off to others.

This is not the timeline to mastery, which is much longer (maybe some day I'll write the post **It Takes a Decade**), but a year of solid, consistent practice is the gateway to being part of a group that can say "I know what I'm doing" with that particular skill.

It's not just any year though, it takes a year *of highly consistent practice.* In Aerial, it was every week, no exceptions. I maybe missed 3 weeks total in my first year. When I went home for the holidays, I looked up the nearest Aerial studio to continue my streak. When my friends wanted to go out for a spontaneous cocktail, I had one only, stayed for a tight hour, then promptly departed for Aerial.

### Year Mindset

I learned to code at Fullstack Academy. In 3 months, I developed a full stack app and understood the basics of web development. At the time, there were probably 1000s of bootcamp grads being turned out every 3 months. I didn't just want to survive in tech, but lead and architect. I sought jobs and gigs with the priority of finding environments where I could continue to learn and grow (rather than find the highest salary or most prestigious job title)
