Start writing...why?

TODO study from cal newport on the productivity

why do I think this is the case? deep thinking.

engineering as we know isnt coding, its maintating that code. The process of writing the code yourself forces you to think through and really understand the context you are in. you are knowledge building.

When AI codes for you, it's pretty much impossible

AI makes us *feel* productiev. and doing things in AI is so easy, we're led to believe there's no reason why we shouldnt do it.
