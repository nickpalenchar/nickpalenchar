# Fitness & Health is always a top proiroty

## Fitness

It doesn't matter what your goals are, being in shape will almost certainly help them. You will have more energy, more focus, you will feel better.

### Yoga/stretching

flexibility and stretching is the key to preventing injury. In other words, it allows you to train longer and get fit faster. I try to stretch whenever I can. I'll do yoga classes when I have time, but I'll also stretch in small intervals (like during pomodoro breaks)

### Climbing

Alex Vermeer wrote that "\[climbing\] feels like cheating." It's fun, challenging, and you can do it for long periods of time (and rest intervals are practically built-in).

#### Strength Training

Lifting heavy weights is one of the fastest ways to build muscle.

I don't have that much time for weight training so I've built up *9 core exercises* that I try to do often. I select 3, do them, note my weights/time, and *try to beat it* the next time around.

#### Aerial Silks

If climbing is like cheating, Aerial silks is cheating on steroids. It's super fun, super challenging, and super creative.

## Clean Eating

I'm not perfect, but I try not to eat sh\*t like, all the time. This could definitely be better. Here's some things I've been working on.

 > 
 > \[!success\] BBGS
 > **B**eans, **B**erries, **G**reens, **S**eeds. Getting these daily takes care of 70% of your diet.

### Fiber

Getting lots more fiber in order to help lower my cholesterol. I try to get at least 15% in the morning (with the overall goal of hitting 25%).

* **Bob's Red Mill Protein Oatmeal** - 21% DV fiber, (bonus 12% DV protein)
* **Beans** - These are quite literally nutrient bullets, and healthiest foods you can find for its price (dirt cheap) I'm learning to make many more dishes with them.
* **Spinach/Kale** - Michael Pollon said all we know about dark, leafy greens is that they "are incredibly good for you."

### Current Diet

My LDL cholesterol was too high by the end of 2025. I've started taking eating more seriously, and after reading the [Engine 2 Diet](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-engine-2-diet-the-texas-firefighter-s-28-day-save-your-life-plan-that-lowers-cholesterol-and-burns-away-the-pounds-rip-esselstyn/b8e670b460eb7f2b) have developed a mostly **Whole food, Vegan-based diet**

My general staples are:

**Proteins** (on order of frequencies):

* **Beans** - Black, refried, cannellini, and kidney (in that order). I've grown to absolutely love beans, and find its the easiest and cheapest way to throw together a meal. When I'm short in time, I'll grill some veggies and throw it in a wrap with refried beans and wild rice. Top with taco hot sauce and I got a delicious and healthy meal in 20 minutes or less.
* **Tofu** - Some complain that tofu has no flavor, but to me its a blank canvas *for* flavor. Some of my favorite dishes:
  * Tofu and sweet Potato peanut curry - I find that the tofu "blends in" with the soft, warm sweet potato as its escort--it literally tricks the taste buds into thinking there's no tofu here.
  * [Chinese Braised Tofu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RABvHkesIQc) by RainbowPlantLife
  * Looking forward to trying Buttery Gochujang Tofu and Broccoli.
  * If all else fails, just a simple [Stir fry](https://nickiscooking.com/recipes/the-stir-fry-blueprint/)
* **Lentils** (all kinds, usually red or green). Exploring a slowcooker spicy coconut-lentil soup. I'm still exploring the possibilities of this more.

**Fiber**

* **Oatmeal**
* **Wild Rice**
* 

**The rest**

* **Greens!**: Spinach, collared greens, kale. I now add them to whatever dish I'm making by default (thanks to the video [My 5 simple steps to eat healthier in 2026](https://youtu.be/qAqpihEKaXM?si=z1Z4THG8vklw646X&t=265), such great ideas)
* **All Other veggies** -
* **Whole wheat Pita**

**Rules at Restaurants**

* Try to stick to the diet if at all possible.
* You pretty much cant trust breads at restaurants, so I try to go with a bowl variant  if possible. I'll occasionally settle for a white wrap.
* I generally find I'm able to piece together a veggie-forward/minimal processed meal out of appetizers and sides (example, chips & guac with a side of grilled veggies)

**Alcohol**
I still drink in moderation and enjoy the camaraderie it brings. I try to follow this order:

* None: Sometimes I can get away
* Red wine
* Gin & soda water
* Beer (1, light, and no other compromises that night). I do love beer and this is the thing I probably miss most.

**Go-To Sides/Snacks**

* [Baked Sweet Potato "Fries"](https://nickiscooking.com/recipes/baked-sweet-potato-fries/)
* Sliced Apple with cinnamon & nut butter

# Focus

In a world of constants digital distraction, being able to deep focus can become a highly valuable skill that could be the bedrock of your entire vocation. Especially in knowledge work, being able to focus deeply for long, uninterrupted periods of time will make you more productive. You'll get shit done faster, you'll upskill faster.

# Resources

* **The Last Safe Investment** - reread that
* **Cal Newports so good they cant ignore you**
* **The Engine 2 Diet**
* The decision book? actually read it?
