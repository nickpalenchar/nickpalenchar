# Fitness & Health is always a top priority

## Fitness

It doesn't matter what your goals are, being in shape will almost certainly help them. You will have more energy, more focus, you will feel better.

Start writing...

### Yoga/stretching

flexibility and stretching is the key to preventing injury. In other words, it allows you to train longer and get fit faster. I try to stretch whenever I can. I'll do yoga classes when I have time, but I'll also stretch in small intervals (like during Pomodoro breaks).

### Climbing

I heard from AV that "[climbing] feels like cheating." It's fun, challenging, and you can do it for long periods of time (rest intervals are practically built in).

#### Strength Training

Lifting heavy weights is one of the fastest ways to build muscle.

I don't have that much time for weight training so I've built up *9 core exercises* that I try to do often. I select 3, do them, note my weights/time, and *try to beat it* the next time around.

#### Aerial Silks

If climbing is like cheating, Aerial silks is cheating on steroids. It's super fun, super challenging, and super creative.

## Clean Eating

I'm not perfect, but I try not to eat sh\*t like, all the time. This could definitely be better. Here's some things I've been working on.

### Fiber

Getting lots more fiber in order to help lower my cholesterol. I try to get at least 15% in the morning (with the overall goal of hitting 25%).

* **Bob's Red Mill Protein Oatmeal** - 21% DV fiber, (bonus 12% DV protein)
* **Beans** - These are quite literally nutrient bullets, and among the healthiest foods you can find for their price (dirt cheap). I'm learning to make many more dishes with them.
* **Spinach/Kale** - Michael Pollan said all we know about dark, leafy greens is that they "are incredibly good for you."

# Focus

In a world of constant digital distraction, being able to deep focus can become a highly valuable skill that could be the bedrock of your entire vocation. Especially in knowledge work, being able to focus deeply for long, uninterrupted periods of time will make you more productive. You'll get shit done faster, you'll upskill faster.

# Resources

* **The Last Safe Investment** - reread that
* **Cal Newport's _So Good They Can't Ignore You_**
* The decision book? actually read it?
