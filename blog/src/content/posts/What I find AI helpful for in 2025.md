Overall I've been pretty unimpressed with AI. I generally find it not to be a suitable replacement TODO

* **general search engine**: If it's common knowledge that I know I'll find the answer to if I google it, AI will often give me an answer faster (and without any ads to navigate... for now)
* **Vibe coding personal tools (sometimes)**: I find AI to be very good at building simple tools and prototypes, especially if they are a solved problem. I recently vibe coded an OAuth app with specific 3LO auth workflows, which I use for testing frequently while developing in a recent project.
* **Code Reviews**: I've found various code review agents to be very effective. They've caught subtle bugs and typos in mine and others' work more than once. This is an inversion of the vibe code mantra (AI code, human reviews), which I find to be a [ very dangerous practice](Vibe%20Coding%20Considered%20Dangerous.md) in its current state.

## Things I DON'T Need AI For

Either because the quality can't be trusted, or it's just unnesscessary

* **Summarizing/rewriting email** - Most emails I receive are already a paragraph or two. Reading the AI summary takes just about as long, and I often miss the nuance in the original email. In the same vein, it's not that difficult to write an email yourself. It again takes about the same amount of time to write it as it takes to give all the details to AI to write for you. I do use things like grammarly for basic grammar and style checking however. To me that's sort of a "static code analysis" but for english.
* **Coding all features**: The disconnect we are building by having AI code for us will eventually make us less capable of being able to identify huge flaws in AI's code, as well as fix them.
* **Generating images for content in blogs etc**: I have a certain appreciation for artistic style, which is totally absent in AI image slop. A trend I've been noticing (especially on linkedin) is that AI images are being added to content *everywhere*. Most of these posts don't even need an image, but linkfluencers cannot *help* but add one, since doing so is so effortless.
* **Generating recipes** - I tried having AI teach me how to make pancakes. Very mid.

AI is still trying to find its place in the world. We'll see how it develops, but for now I'm very aware of the hidden cognitive cost we are very likely paying into.
