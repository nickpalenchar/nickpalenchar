I fully deleted my Instagram at the start of 2025. It was the culmination many years of curbing my reliance on addictive technology (not to mention the atrocious leadership and terrible practices Meta constantly employs). Since then (and even before) I've had many conversations with people about Instagram, which most often goes a certain way: They don't like instagram, they want to be off it, but...

There's always a *"but"*.

I've been sympathetic to the fact that social media can provide genuine value to your personal and professional life, which makes it feel like a necessary evil (by design!). But unfortunately, none of these reasons are good enough to stay on Instagram.

Now that I'm fully removed from the app myself, I've started to feel more compelled to start calling bullshit on all the reasons why others are still part of Meta (yes I'm great at parties).

### Staying in touch with friends

I remember reconnecting with an old classmate because I discovered we were both visiting Acadia national park at the same time. I only knew this because I noticed her geo-tagged story. I won't have that coincidence again now that I'm off of Instagram. I also have friends who are much more likely to respond on Instagram than on a text.

But here's the hard truth: friends that are worth your while will text you. And you will reach out to friends that are truly worth your time to ask about what they've been up to. And for how cool it was to be able to use Instagram as way to serendipitously find myself near my old classmate, that was one benefit among what would probably be hundreds to thousands of hours wasting my time, connecting with no one. So from a cost/benefit analysis, cutting this off is a net positive.

Meta themselves have actually agued they are [no longer social media apps](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-reveals-decline-friend-content-instagram-facebook-amid-ftc-trial-2025-4), citing most users spend just 7% of their time actually viewing content from people they know!

### Business Prospects

This is harder, sure. Many businesses are on Instagram, where it can be very easy to connect with a potentially large set of users.

My view is honestly quite similar to the friends argument, which is centered on the principle that humans can always find a solution with the tools they've been given. Sourcing leads on instagram could very well be the easiest solution for a business. But if you take that away, you will then be forced to find what the next easiest solution is (one which you may never have seen if you're on Instagram and default to that.)

If that really doesn't seem feasible, the recommendation is to really *just use it for business*, which is harder than it sounds. However social media tools like HootSuite can assist with being more removed from the addictive parts of the app. Having Instagram on a second phone (your "work phone") is another pretty good solution. If it doesn't seem worth paying for a social media management tool or using your old phone to use Instagram, then perhaps go back to the first point on finding alternate ways to connect/advertise with your user base off the platform.
