  <h1>Hi 👋 I'm Nick</h1>

  <p>I'm a human that grew up in the Arts, but a number of early learn-to-code groups such as <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>
    brought me into the world of software and I've never looked back.
  </p>

  <p>I've worked at startups and large companies, and am currently 
    at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com" target="_blank">Atlassian.</a></p>
  
  <p>I'm a Digital Minimalist (aspiring) and equate social media to smoking.</p>
  
  <p>I've spent most of my life trying to figure out how best to organize my thoughts, ideas, and time. I still haven't found the best way.</p>

  <p>I ❤️ Open Source and believe in the power of a free and open internet. Most of my projects are dedicated to ad-free software and open exchange of knowledge.</p>

  <p>I also play piano!</p>
