My annual Drop of the best articles and other interesting things I've read in 2022.

> Note: These are not necessarily things _published_ in 2022, but the things I've discovered.

## Best Articles
- **If you only read one:** **[The Elements of git](https://cuddly-octo-palm-tree.com/posts/2021-09-19-git-elements/)**
  - _Runner up_: [Learn the inner workings of git, not just the commands](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/d-learn-workings-git/)
- [Building A JavaScript Bundler](https://cpojer.net/posts/building-a-javascript-bundler)
- [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)]
- [Git commands explained with Cats](https://girliemac.com/blog/2017/12/26/git-purr/)
- [Reflections on 10,000 hrs of programming](https://matt-rickard.com/reflections-on-10-000-hours-of-programming)

## Best Top Workflow Improvements
- Setting git diff to diff3 (thanks https://blog.nilbus.com/take-the-pain-out-of-git-conflict-resolution-use-diff3/)

## Best Tool added to my Dev Toolbox

- [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) and [astexplorer.net](https://astexplorer.net/). Powerful stuff.

## Best Online Course

- [Everyday Typescript (executeprogram)](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/everyday-typescript) (paid) - one of the best
online courses I've _ever_ taken. Completely demystified TypeScript, especially around the _why_ and _how to resolve_ of type errors.

## Other cool sh*t

- [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/) is a private YouTube desktop client (I love the idea of having
a dedicated client outside my browser tabs for YouTube in general)
