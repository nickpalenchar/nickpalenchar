No annoying intro here. This is it:

## "When starting a blog, be sure to update it regularly"

I've actually heard or read this general "nugget" many times. It is as ubiquitous as it is terrible. One reason is that it's only applicable to one type of blog. The kind that is monetized, relying on a large group of subscribers, with aspirations of generating a livable wage for the author. Obviously, there are many types of blogs.

Back in 2018 I had set a goal to publish one post a month. I thought it was modest at the time (some authors seem to post weekly at least), but it turned out to be GRUELING. It also didn't produce work I was most proud of. The result of this goal is most of the 2018 posts on this site (you might notice there's less than 12).

The fact that I couldn't commit made me question if I should even host a blog at all. I felt like a blog with large gaps in the timeline would give the same impression a "streaky" resume gives off. As a matter-of-fact, the aforementioned terrible advice is often paired with a warning that you will look like you lack a drive for commitment, which could turn off recruiters during the job search, if you don't post regularly.

This is equally misguided. When I look at my blog, I see a collection of articles that generally represents my thoughts on coding, and general values in the industry. These are topics that are valuable to me, the topics I want to talk about. I don't want it cluttered with noise that is less helpful to readers or myself. Form the viewpoint of a recruiter, wouldn't they rather find content that supports the author's expertise in the field?

I'm not really sure what my blog is. Heck why does it matter? I just enjoy my tiny space on the corner of the internet I can call my own! Maybe it's a subtle rebellion against larger platforms (blog and social media based). But the autonomy makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.

For me, it's helpful to write my thoughts whenever I'm moved to do so. And I hope the result is a collection of genuine thoughts and advice that others might find helpful, too.
