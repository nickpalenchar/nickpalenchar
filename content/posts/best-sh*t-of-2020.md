## Best Articles

- **[Deploys at Slack](https://slack.engineering/deploys-at-slack/)** 
- **[The first two lines of your bash shell Should Be](https://ashishb.net/all/the-first-two-statements-of-your-bash-script-should-be/)** - Or, unofficial Bash "strict mode." Saves you from common shell headaches.
- **User Engagement is Code for Addiction** - This article unfortunately was [taken down by Medium](/organizing-knowledge/#but-im-stil-in-control) (presumably because they employ this kind of addiction on their
own platform)
- **[How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall In Love With You](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/)** - We all want
our code review lives to be easier.
- **[The Two Minute Rule](https://hoanhan.co/posts/2-minute-rule/)** - If you need an easy way to motivate yourself.
- **[I Push Therefore I am: 2 Days at Etsy](http://mhawthorne.net/posts/2013-etsy-netflix-I-push-therefore-I-am/)** - it's fascinating to me that Netflx and Etsy once had a "developer exchange program" (seriously how did HR and compliance work?), so a story around that experience is pretty neat to see documented.
- **[Self Directed Learning](https://www.jjude.com/sdl/)** - A comprehensive framework to learning how to learn.

## Best Sites

- **[https://wizardzines.com/]** Julia Evans has the coolest style, combining comic book structures with
highly insightful technical instruction (especially around linux). A dream resource for any visual learner.

## Best Course I took

- **[The Missing Semester of your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)** - While geared towards undergrads
who are _about_ to go into the professional world, this course is an amazing survey of how we can best code professionally, and I recommend it to every one. Even if you've been in the field for a few years, chances are
there's at least one new thing you'll learn from this course, probably more.
