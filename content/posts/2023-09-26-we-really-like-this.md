I started thinking about remote work in 2018. I landed a new backend role at a startup. On the phone,
the CTO talked about how he was fairly strict about people actually coming into the office. "I really
value the people-debating-around-a-whiteboard kind of work," he said.

I found this to be true. We were around white boards a lot, drawing and erasing arrows, boxes, and
annotations.
