## Books that changed my life (non-technical)
21. {{< popout-link "The Defining Decade" "https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-defining-decade-why-your-twenties-matter-and-how-to-make-the-most-of-them-now-revised-meg-jay/14937541?ean=9781538754238" >}}

1. {{< popout-link "Eat and Run: My Unlikely Journey to Ultramarathon greatness" "https://bookshop.org/p/books/eat-and-run-my-unlikely-journey-to-ultramarathon-greatness-steve-friedman/7083362?ean=9780544002319" >}} - More than anything, it taught me the hard lesson that "sometimes you just do things" you wish you didn't have to do.

## Talks, Lectures, Videos

## Shell tools
41. {{< popout-link "My own dotfiles" "https://github.com/nickpalenchar/dotfiles" >}} - everyone's #1 in the shell should be _their own scripts_, since that's the best way to remember so many aliases for so many programs.
1. {{< popout-link "AWK" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK" >}} - There will come a time when you need to quickly make sense out of a lot
of text-based data (think logs and shell output), and even a little bit of awk will take you very far. See also [why you should learn a just a little awk](https://gregable.com/2010/09/why-you-should-know-just-little-awk.html)

## Frameworks and Libraries

51. React - while I hesitate to rely on large front-end SPA frameworks, the patters and composition React has
brought to html (as well as its stellar documentation), can't be beat.
1. {{< popout-link "Hugo" "gohugo.io" >}} Hugo's well thought out file structure, beautiful set of clean themes, and super fast builds
makes building static websites fun again (this site is built with Hugo)
1. [Vue]
1. {{< popout-link "Cookiecutter" "https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" >}} - for templating entire projects
1. {{< popout-link "PlopJS" "https://plopjs.com/" >}} - for templating single files.

### Honorable Mentions

- For writing CLI's in Javascript, there's [CommanderJS](https://github.com/tj/commander.js)
- For writing CLI's in Python, [docopt](https://pypi.org/project/docopt/) parses the already-standardized
docstrings from python files.
