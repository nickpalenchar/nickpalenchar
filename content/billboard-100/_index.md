## Shell tools
1. [My own dotfiles](https://github.com/nickpalenchar/dotfiles) - everyone's #1 in the shell should be _their own scripts_, since that's the best way to remember so many aliases for so many programs.
1. [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) - There will come a time when you need to quickly make sense out of a lot
of text-based data (think logs and shell output), and even a little bit of awk will take you very far. See also [why you should learn a just a little awk](https://gregable.com/2010/09/why-you-should-know-just-little-awk.html)

## Frameworks and Libraries

1. React - while I hesitate to rely on large front-end SPA frameworks, the patters and composition React has
brought to html (as well as its stellar documentation), can't be beat.
1. [Hugo](gohugo.io) Hugo's well thought out file structure, beautiful set of clean themes, and super fast builds
makes building static websites fun again (this site is built with Hugo)
1. [Vue]
